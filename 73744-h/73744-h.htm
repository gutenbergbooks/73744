Chemists, and others, prove loose powders are, almost without exception, made from
alum, and at a cost of about one tenth of what a pure Cream Tartar powder, like the “<span class="smcap">Royal</span>”

of such poisonous stuff, the cost of can, label, etc., is used simply to enable the seller to make
a larger profit in selling an alum bulk, or loose, powder at the expense of the unsuspecting
consumer, than can be made by selling the absolutely pure “<span class="smcap">Royal</span>” brand. Remember this,
and insist on getting the “<span class="smcap">Royal</span>” in cans.</p>

<p class="noindent drop-cap"><span class="uc">Hints on Baking.</span>—To achieve perfect success, the cook must use discrimination and
care. Some flour requires more water, or milk, than others; so that the quantity
may have to be varied to make dough of a proper consistency. Different bakings will
vary as to time and heat required, and should, therefore, be examined occasionally. To
ascertain whether the bread is sufficiently done in the center of the loaf or cake, thrust a clean
straw or long thin splinter into it. If done, there will be no dough on it when drawn out.
Measure the flour, and <em>be careful to mix with it the baking powder in a dry state, and before sifting</em>.
You can always substitute water for milk, or milk for water; butter for lard, or lard for
butter. The number of eggs may be increased or diminished, or, in plainer cake, etc., dispensed
with entirely. Where fewer eggs are used than directed, always use a little more baking
powder. <em>Never use sour milk.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> about to cut new bread or cake, heat the knife very hot; this will prevent its
crumbling.</p>

<p><span class="uc">Cake Baking.</span>—For a plain cake made with one pound of flour, Royal Baking Powder,
etc., the time to be allowed in baking would be from 40 to 50 minutes; at the outside not more
than 1 hour. Very rich cakes, in which butter and eggs predominate, take, of course, very
much longer time to bake, a pound cake taking from 1½ to 2 hours, and a bride’s cake 3½.
On no account should an oven be too hot when the cake is put in—that is, hot enough to
brown at once; if so, in 5 minutes the whole outside will be burned and the interior will stand
little chance of being baked. The old plan of feeling the handle of the oven door to test the
heat is not always successful; it is better to sprinkle a little flour inside and shut the door for
about 3 minutes; if at the end of that time it is of a rich light brown, the cake may be put in,
but if burned the heat must be lessened.</p>

<p>In baking loaf cake, remember that unless you place a piece of paper over for protection at
first, a top crust will be formed at once that prevents the raising. When cake is well raised,
remove the paper for browning on top.</p>

<p><span class="uc">Advice to the Cook.</span>—Great cleanliness, as well as care and attention, are required
from a cook. Keep your hands <em>very</em> clean; try to prevent your nails from getting black or
discolored; don’t “scatter” in your kitchen; clean up as you go; put cold water into each
saucepan or stewpan as you finish using it. Dry your saucepans before you put them on the
shelf. Scour tins with good mineral soap and rinse thoroughly in hot water. In cleaning a
frying-pan, scour the <em>outside</em> as well as the inside. In cleaning greasy utensils, such as the
soup-pot and frying-pan, wipe off the worst of the grease with soft paper (which can be
burned), then soak in warm water to which soap-powder or a little ammonia has been added,
finishing with mineral soap. Wash your pudding-cloths, <em>scald</em>, and hang them to dry directly
after using them; air them before you put them away, or they will be musty: keep in dry
place. Be careful not to use a knife that has cut onions till it has been cleaned. Keep sink
and sink-brush very clean; be careful never to throw anything but water down sink. Do not
throw cabbage water down it; throw it away out of doors; its smell is very bad. Never have
sticky plates or dishes; use very hot water for washing them; when greasy, change it. Take
care that you look at the meat the butcher brings, to see that it is good. Let there be no
waste in the kitchen.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="BREAD">Bread and Rolls</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent drop-cap"><span class="uc">Bread</span> was first made without leaven,
heavy and solid. Then yeast was discovered,
and yeast-risen bread came into
use throughout the civilized world. Finally
baking powder was devised, the most healthful,
economical, and convenient of all leavening
or lightening agents.</p>

<p>Yeast is a living plant. Mixed with the
dough it causes fermentation and destruction
of a part of the flour, and this produces carbonic-acid
gas. The bubbles of this gas become
entangled in the dough, swelling it up and
making it spongy. In this process, however,
a part of the most nutritious elements of the
flour (estimated at ten per cent.) is destroyed
in producing the leavening gas; there is always
danger of sour dough, and there is a
delay of many hours for the sponge to rise.</p>

<p>Perfect bread is that in which wheat is transposed
into an available food without loss of
any of its valuable properties.</p>

<p>Royal Baking Powder is now largely used in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
place of yeast to leaven bread. It does precisely
the same work—that is, swells up the
dough and makes it porous and spongy. But
the process is not destructive: the baking
powder by itself produces the leavening gas.
No part of the flour is decomposed or destroyed.
Moreover, there is no mixing or
kneading with the hands, no setting of sponge
overnight, as the loaf is mixed and ready for
the oven at once. Bread thus made cannot
sour, but will retain its moisture and freshness,
and may be eaten while hot or fresh without
distress even by persons of delicate digestion.</p>

<p>The ease with which Royal Baking Powder
bread is made, its cleanliness and healthfulness,
have caused it to supersede yeast bread
with many of the best pastry cooks.</p>

<p>In making this bread the materials and
utensils should be brought together before the
mixing of the dough is begun. The fire must
be looked to so as to secure a steady, moderate
heat. Remember to mix the flour and Royal
Baking Powder together before sifting, and
sift thoroughly before wetting.</p>


<p><b>Royal Baking Powder Bread.</b>—1 quart flour,
1 teaspoon salt, ½ teaspoon sugar, 2 heaping
teaspoons Royal Baking Powder,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">*</a> ½
medium-sized cold boiled potato, and water.
Sift together thoroughly flour, salt, sugar, and
baking powder; rub in the potato; add sufficient
water to mix smoothly and rapidly into a
stiff dough, about the consistency of cake batter:
about a pint of water to a quart of flour
will be required—more or less according to the
brand and quality of the flour used. Do not
make a stiff dough as in yeast bread. Put the
dough into a greased pan 4½ by 8 inches, and
4 inches deep, filling about half full. The loaf
will rise to fill the pan when baked. Bake in
very hot oven about 45 minutes, placing paper
over first 15 minutes’ baking, to prevent crusting
too soon on top. Bake immediately after
mixing.</p>

<div class="footnote">

</div>


<p class="noindent drop-cap"><span class="uc">Experienced</span> housekeepers agree that
breakfast is difficult to cater for. Even
the appetite ordinarily easy to satisfy is
likely to be captious when approaching the
first meal of the day. Every article of food
upon the breakfast-table, therefore, should be
perfect—the coffee as clear as amber, the
bacon white and crisp, the biscuits flaky, tender,
delicious.</p>

<p>As a nation we approve of hot-breads, and
most of all at the breakfast-table. And while
we eat and enjoy them, we have the satisfaction
of knowing that American methods and
American cookery have made them healthful
as well as appetizing and nutritious.</p>

<p>And of all the breakfast foods, nothing is
so appetizing, so appetite-whetting, so always
dependable, so satisfying, as the light, flaky,
hot biscuit, with a crisp, brown crust, just
from the oven, broken apart without use of
knife, and spread with butter; or, to top off
the meal, with honey, jam, or marmalade.</p>

<p>The very simplicity of the methods of making
and the familiar, every-day use of this
little hot bread-morsel have, however, sometimes
led to lack of care in its preparation, so
that we too seldom find it in perfection upon
our tables.</p>

<p>It is the object of this chapter to stimulate
an interest in and awaken a love for this most
healthful and economical of our purely American
foods, so that it will be found, as it deserves
to be, a prominent part of every day’s
food in every household.</p>

<p>With a basis of flour, salt, and Royal Baking
Powder, we can add other ingredients to vary
and enrich the cakes and biscuits generally
known to the housewife, and produce in almost
endless variety breakfast and luncheon
foods that shall be dainty and delicious or substantial
and hearty.</p>

<p>Are eggs scarce and high, does too much
shortening disagree with some member of the
family, Royal Baking Powder permits the lessening
of both or either of these ingredients,
without impairing the delicacy or digestibility
of the finished biscuit.</p>

<p>Royal Baking Powder is pure and healthful,
and its use in excess can produce no harm; yet
for cooking results it is best to be guided by the
quantity specified in the receipts. Baking
powder could be added until a dry, powdery
biscuit resulted.</p>

<p>The mixing of the baking powder, flour, and
other dry ingredients should be thorough.
This is imperative if a delicate, evenly leavened
biscuit is wanted. The other ingredients
can then be added, following the special directions
as given in each receipt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span></p>

<p>In using shortening for biscuits, especially
through the winter season, with some limitation,
good, sweet home-made lard may take
the place of butter. Butter will color slightly
yellow; lard will whiten the biscuits. This
substitution will not do when considerable
shortening is called for, as in cake; but in
receipts where the quantity does not exceed
2 ounces or tablespoons to the quart of flour,
butter may, in the majority of cases, be replaced
by lard without impairing the taste.</p>

<p>Biscuits are mixed to a soft dough, which is
turned out, patted down or rolled to a proper
thickness, and then cut out and baked. From
long experience it has been found that the result
is much better and the food more digestible
when the finished biscuit is small and not too
thick. The scientific reason for this is that the
oven heat necessary for biscuit, if they are made
very large, will brown the outside before the
center is as thoroughly baked as it ought to be.
The dough should be rolled out until ½ inch
thick; the biscuits should be of medium size,—2
inches or less across,—and placed slightly
apart in the pans. A favorite cutter of expert
biscuit-makers is the open end (not the cover)
of a ¼-pound Royal Baking Powder can. A
good oven heat will bake the biscuit perfectly
in from 15 to 20 minutes, and even a dyspeptic
can eat them without fear of consequences.
The biscuit may, of course, be made thicker or
thinner, as more or less of the soft inside part
may be preferred, but the time of baking must
be regulated accordingly.</p>

<p>The same directions will apply to hot baking
powder breads made with a batter. If baked
in a sheet the batter should rarely be more
than an inch deep in the pan, sometimes less;
if in cups or molds they should not be more
than ⅔ full. This allows the heat to penetrate
the mixture quickly; the moisture and
heat start the baking powder into life; each
tiny grain of the powder acts on the materials
surrounding it; the dough or batter expands,
then is stiffened by the heat, and all the starch
grains are thoroughly and evenly cooked.</p>


<p><b>Royal Hot Biscuit.</b>—1 quart flour, 1 teaspoon
salt, 2 teaspoons Royal Baking Powder,
1 tablespoon lard or butter, 1 pint sweet milk,
cold (never use sour milk); use cold water
when milk cannot be obtained. Sift together
flour, salt, and powder; rub in shortening;
add milk; form into smooth, consistent dough.
Flour the board, turn out dough, roll out to
thickness of ½ inch, cut with small round cutter;
lay them close together on greased baking-tin;
bake in good hot oven. Old biscuit
can be made fresh by moistening and placing in
oven until heated through.</p>


<p><b>Breakfast Biscuit.</b>—Take 1 quart sweet
milk, ½ cup melted butter, a little salt, 2 teaspoons
Royal Baking Powder, flour enough to
make a stiff batter; do not knead into dough,
but drop into buttered tins from a spoon; bake
in a hot oven—unless it is hot they will not
be light and tender.</p>


<p><b>Emergency Biscuit.</b>—2 cups flour, ½ teaspoon
salt, 1 teaspoon Royal Baking Powder;
mix and sift; rub in 1 tablespoon butter. Mix
to a thick batter with milk, drop by small

into circles, place 1 inch apart on greased pans.
Brush with little beaten egg, and bake in very
hot oven.</p>


<p><b>Sandwich Biscuit.</b>—Sift together 1 pint
flour, ⅓ teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon Royal Baking
Powder. Rub in 1 heaping tablespoon butter.
Mix to a soft dough with milk. Roll out

teaspoon salt, 1 heaping teaspoon Royal Baking
Powder. Rub in 1 heaping tablespoon butter,
add 1 cup ground or very finely chopped
nuts—English walnuts, hickory nuts, or
almonds—and 2 tablespoons sugar; mix to a
soft dough with milk. Mold with the hands
into small balls, place well apart on greased
pans, brush each with milk, put a pinch of
chopped nuts on top, and bake in hot oven.</p>


<p><b>Diamonds.</b>—Prepare dough as for Royal
biscuit. Knead and roll out ½ inch thick.
Cut in strips 2 inches wide, then cut strips
into diamonds; place on greased pans 1 inch
apart, brush with milk, and bake in very hot
oven.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Fritters_and_Waffles">Fritters and Waffles</h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent drop-cap"><span class="uc">Fritters</span> are served as a vegetable or a
sweet, for a lunch, dinner, or supper,
according to the ingredients used in making
them. Whether sweet or plain, the foundation
batter is much the same, and, with some
additions, the first receipt given in this chapter
can be used for many kinds of fritters.
By the use of Royal Baking Powder a fine fritter
batter may be stirred up in a moment, and
a meal which it may be thought necessary to
extend, perhaps because of unexpected guests,
can be embellished by the addition of a delicate
and tasty dish.</p>

<p>A fritter batter which is to be used as a
medium for whole or sliced fruit should be
quite thin, as it is to serve as a cover for the
fruit. When chopped fruits or vegetables are
stirred in, or the batter is to be used plain, it
should be thick enough to retain its shape
when dropped by spoonfuls into the frying-kettle.
The fat should be deep enough to
cover the fritters, and it should be smoking
hot when used. Each fritter will at first sink
to the bottom of the kettle; then, as the heat
starts the baking powder into action and the
dough begins to swell, it will rise to the surface,
and should be gently turned, the turning to be
repeated until the fritter is finely colored. Most
fritters are done within five minutes, the time
needed to cook them being determined by one
which should be cooked as a tester.</p>

<p>The very word “waffles” brings to our minds
a host of pleasant recollections. The only
drawback, in the old days, was that they must be
started so long before they were ready for the
irons, for home-made yeast took time to raise
the batter to the requisite degree of lightness.
Now, by the use of Royal Baking Powder, they
can be prepared in five minutes. They are
better than of old, too, for there is no yeasty
taste to them; they are light, tender, and
toothsome, and, what is most important, entirely
digestible and wholesome.</p>


<p><b>Plain Fritter Batter.</b>—1 cup flour, ½ teaspoon
Royal Baking Powder, ¼ teaspoon salt, 2
eggs, 1 cup milk. Sift dry ingredients together;
add beaten eggs and milk; beat till smooth.</p>


<p><b>Apple Fritters.</b>—4 large sound apples,
peeled, cored, and cut each into 4 slices, ½ gill
wine, 2 tablespoons sugar, 1 teaspoon extract

</div>


<p class="noindent drop-cap"><span class="uc">The</span> griddle cake as made to-day with
Royal Baking Powder is another article
of food which has taken high rank
upon the American table. The heavy, sour,
grease-soaked, indigestible griddle cake of old
is, where modern methods are employed, a
thing of the past. The properly made griddle
cake is a delicious food, healthful, appetizing,
and nutritious.</p>

<p>Raising the griddle cake with yeast is altogether
obsolete with expert cooks. Mixtures
of soda, saleratus, sour milk, buttermilk, etc.,
are likewise not permissible. Royal Baking
Powder has altogether redeemed the griddle
cake. It makes the cake light, tender, digestible,
and its preparation and baking are the
work of a moment only.</p>

<p>Royal Baking Powder, plain, sweet milk,
flour, and a little salt make a food fit for a
feast. What so simple, so easily prepared?
Eggs are altogether unessential.</p>

<p>The batter must be thin, the cakes made
small and not too thick,—about a good ⅛ inch
thick when baked,—browned, and neatly
turned. The griddle must be merely rubbed
with grease, not grease-soaked. This is highly
important. Take a thick piece of salt pork
on a fork, or a lump of suet in a piece of
cheese-cloth, and rub lightly over the hot griddle
and pour the batter on immediately.</p>

<p>Remember that buckwheat is one of the
most difficult flours to lighten. Where it enters
into combination with other materials this
fact must be recognized and a somewhat larger
proportion of Royal Baking Powder allowed.
Made in the manner directed in these receipts
buckwheat cakes can be safely and profusely
eaten by every one.</p>


<p><b>Royal Wheat Cakes.</b>—This is the best plain
hot griddle cake without eggs. The cakes will
be light, tender, and healthful. 1 quart flour,
3 teaspoons Royal Baking Powder, ½ teaspoon
salt. Sift well together and add sweet milk to
make into a soft batter. Bake immediately on
hot griddle. Should be full ⅛ inch thick when
baked. Smother with butter and maple syrup
or honey.</p>


<p><b>Griddle Cakes with Eggs.</b>—3 cups flour, 2
teaspoons Royal Baking Powder, 1 teaspoon
salt. Mix well together, add 2 well-beaten
eggs and sufficient sweet milk to make a thin
drop batter. Bake at once on a hot, well-greased
griddle. Make them thin.</p>


<p><b>Graham Griddle Cakes.</b>—1 pint Graham
flour, ½ pint Indian corn meal, ½ pint flour,
1 heaping teaspoon brown sugar, ½ teaspoon
salt, 2 teaspoons Royal Baking Powder, 1 egg,

and powder. Add beaten egg, milk, and water.
Mix together into a smooth batter. Heat
griddle <em>hot</em>, pour batter into cakes as large as
a tea saucer. Bake brown on one side, carefully
turn and brown other side. Pile one on
the other, serve very hot, with sugar, milk,
cream, or maple syrup.</p>

and sugar to white, light cream; add yolks
of eggs, 1 at a time. Sift flour, salt, and powder
together; add to butter, etc., with milk
and egg whites whipped to dry froth; mix
together into a smooth batter. Bake in small
cakes; as soon as brown, turn and brown the
other side. Have buttered baking-tin; fast as
browned, lay them on it, and spread raspberry
jam over them; then bake more, which lay on
others already done. Repeat this until you
have used jam twice, then bake another batch,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
which use to cover them. Sift sugar plentifully
over them, place in a moderate oven to
finish cooking.</p>


<p><b>Three-Egg Griddle Cakes.</b>—3 cups milk, 2
heaping cups flour, ½ teaspoon salt, 3 eggs, 2
teaspoons Royal Baking Powder. Mix as for

beaten eggs, milk, and huckleberries (washed
and picked over). Mix into batter that will
run from pitcher in thick, continuous stream.
Have griddle hot enough to form crust soon as
batter touches it. In order to confine juice of
berries, turn quickly, so as to form crust on
other side; turn once more on each side to
complete baking. Blackberry or raspberry
griddle cakes in same manner.</p>

beaten eggs and milk, mix into a smooth batter.
Bake on very hot griddle to a nice brown.
Serve with molasses or maple syrup.</p>


<p><b>Royal Buckwheats.</b>—This is the most delicious
of all the griddle cakes. It has been
against buckwheat cakes when made from
yeast or risen overnight that it was difficult
to make them light and sweet, and that disagreeable
effects followed their eating. It is
found that by the use of the Royal Baking
Powder to raise the batter these objections
have been entirely overcome, and that buckwheat
cakes are made a most delicious food,
light, sweet, tender, and perfectly wholesome,
that can be eaten by any one without the
slightest digestive inconvenience. 2 cups
pure buckwheat (do not use the so-called “prepared”
or “self-raising” flours), 1 cup wheat
flour, 2 tablespoons Royal Baking Powder,
½ teaspoon salt, all sifted well together.
Mix with sweet milk into thin batter, and bake
at once on a hot griddle.</p>


<p><b>Buckwheat Cakes.</b>—To 1½ pints pure
buckwheat flour (never use prepared or self-raising
flour) add ¼ pint each wheat flour
and Indian meal, 3 heaping teaspoons Royal
Baking Powder, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 tablespoon
brown sugar or molasses. Sift well together,
in dry state, buckwheat, Indian meal, wheat
flour, and baking powder, then add remainder;
when ready to bake add 1 pint water or sufficient
to form smooth batter that will run in a
stream (not too thin) from pitcher; make
griddle hot and cakes as large as a saucer.
When surface is covered with air-holes it is
time to turn cakes over; take off when sufficiently
browned.</p>


<p><b>Bread Cakes.</b>-½ pound bread, 1 pint flour,
1 teaspoon brown sugar, ½ teaspoon salt, 1½
teaspoons Royal Baking Powder, ¾ pint milk,
1 egg. Put bread, free from crust, to steep in
warm water. When thoroughly soaked, wring
dry in a towel; dilute with beaten egg and
milk. Sift together flour, sugar, salt, and
powder, add to prepared bread, mix together
into a smooth batter. Bake on well-heated
griddle. Serve with sugar and cream.</p>

1 tablespoon brown sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, 2
heaping teaspoons Royal Baking Powder, 2
eggs, 1½ pints milk. Sift together flour,
sugar, salt, and powder; add beaten eggs and

in rather continuous stream from pitcher.
Bake on good hot griddle rich brown color, in
cakes large as tea saucers. Serve with maple
syrup.</p>


<p><b>Hominy Griddle Cakes.</b>—Proceed as directed

syrup.</p>


<p><b>Pancakes.</b>—1 pint flour, 6 eggs, 1 saltspoon
salt, 1 teaspoon Royal Baking Powder, and
milk to make a thin batter. Add the baking
powder to the flour, beat the whites and yolks
of eggs separately; add the yolks, salt, 2 cups
milk, then the whites and the flour alternately
with milk, until the batter is of right consistency.
Run 1 teaspoon lard over the bottom
of a hot frying-pan, pour in a large ladleful of
batter, and fry quickly. Roll pancake up like a
sheet of paper, lay upon a hot dish, put in more
lard, and fry another pancake. Keep hot over
boiling water. Send ½ dozen to table at a
time. Serve with sauce, jelly, or preserves.</p>


<p><b>English Pancakes.</b>—1 pint milk, 2 eggs, 1
tablespoon sugar, 1 cup flour, 1 teaspoon Royal
Baking Powder, 1 cup cream, pinch salt. Sift
flour, salt, and powder together; add to it eggs
beaten with sugar and diluted with milk and
cream; mix into thin batter. Have small
round frying-pan; melt little butter in it; pour
about ½ cup batter in it, turn pan round, that
batter may cover the pan, put on hot fire;
turn it and brown other side. Butter each and
roll it up; sprinkle with powdered sugar.</p>


<p><b>French Pancakes.</b>—Proceed as directed for
English pancakes; when all are done, spread
each with any kind of preserves, roll up, sift
over plenty sugar, glaze with red-hot poker.</p>

<h3>Flour</h3>

<p class="noindent drop-cap"><span class="uc">Fancy-cake</span> makers and confectioners
prefer to use “pastry” flour for the
making of cakes and pastry, which is a
flour of different grade from that used for
bread and general baking purposes. Bread
flour contains a large proportion of gluten, the
nitrogenous property of the wheat grain, which
gives bone and muscle, and makes bread a
nutritious food. When bread flour is used for
cake and pie crust the result is not quite as
flaky and light as it should be, because of the
gluten in the flour. A special sack of pastry flour
for use in making fine cakes and pastry will be
advantageous. In appearance pastry flour is
whiter than bread flour. When rubbed between
the fingers it feels as soft and fine as corn-starch;
if squeezed in the hand it forms a firm
ball. Because of this tendency to “pack” it
should always be sifted very thoroughly.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, Royal Baking Powder
used with any good flour will make satisfactory
cake which will be creditable to any housekeeper.</p>


<h3>Royal Baking Powder</h3>

<p>In no department of cookery is Royal Baking
Powder of greater use and importance than
in making fine cake. Eggs are too expensive
nowadays to be used as lavishly as they were
a generation ago—ten or more to a cake. Not
as a substitute wholly, but as an accessory,—as
an aid toward producing the lightness and
digestibility of the food,—we use the Royal
Baking Powder. We thereby obtain uniformly
good results and do a large amount of work at
a minimum expense. The quantity called for
by the receipt should be thoroughly mixed
with the flour before the latter is sifted.</p>

<p>The Royal Baking Powder has worked a
revolution in cake-making. It is now no
trouble to make at home the finest cakes in
almost endless variety, which shall rival the
productions of the confectioner. If you follow
these directions there will be no spoiled or
heavy cakes, no wasted materials through failures
in mixing or baking.</p>


<h3>To Mix Cakes Containing Butter</h3>

<p>Cream the butter, beating till light. Gradually
add the sugar, beating till light and
creamy. Add the yolks of eggs beaten till
light, then the flavoring. Beat in alternately
the liquid and flour, the latter mixed with salt
and baking powder. Lastly, add the beaten
whites, and fruit, if used.</p>


<h3>To Mix Cakes Containing No Butter</h3>

<p>Beat the egg yolks until very light and thick.
Add the sugar gradually, beating till very
light and spongy. Add the flavoring and
liquid, if used. Have the whites of eggs
whipped to a stiff froth. Add them alternately
with the sifted flour (mixed with baking powder),
and cut both in very lightly and quickly.</p>


<h3>To Bake Cakes</h3>

<p>Thin cakes need a hotter oven than loaf
cakes. Cakes without butter (sponge cakes)
should have a more moderate, longer baking
than cakes of same size containing butter.
The process of baking may be divided into
four periods or quarters of time: in first quarter
the cake begins to rise; in second quarter
it is still rising and begins to color; in third
quarter it browns all over; in last quarter it
shrinks from sides of pan.</p>

<p>To test, insert a clean broom-straw into the
middle of the cake; if it comes out clean, the
cake is done. Hold the pan to the ear; it
should scarcely “sing.”</p>

<p>Line loaf-cake pans with buttered paper;
fruit cakes need several thicknesses of the
same.</p>

<p>Do not use sour milk, buttermilk, or any of
the so-called prepared or self-raising flours.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Fruit_Short_Cakes">Fruit Short Cakes</h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent drop-cap"><span class="uc">The</span> old-fashioned fruit short cakes were
generally made with flour, soda, sour
milk, and shortening, and were restricted
to the strawberry season. We now use Royal
Baking Powder for lightening them, employ
all the fruits of the various seasons, and thus
feast ourselves upon the delicate confections
almost the whole year through. The short
cake made with Royal Baking Powder and
sweet milk is incomparably better, surer, and
more healthful than the old-fashioned concoction.
Too much skill was required in combining
soda and sour milk. The milk had to be
at just the right stage of sourness; not a grain
more of soda could be used than was sufficient
to neutralize the acid in the milk, or the cake
would be yellow, with a disagreeable odor and
soapy taste; if too little, the cake was heavy.
But even the young or inexperienced housekeeper
will find that with Royal Baking Powder
a perfect short cake is an easy and agreeable
task. The baking powder only needs to be
thoroughly sifted with the flour, so that it may
evenly lighten the cake. Use sweet milk always.
For the old-fashioned short cake no
eggs are needed, the dough being put together
in the same way as for baking powder biscuit.</p>

<p>Throughout the summer fresh fruit of all
kinds can be used. With cold weather substitutes
are found in tropical fruits such as bananas
and oranges, stewed fruits such as prunes,
dried, and all varieties of canned fruits; but it
is better to keep the fruit short cake for those
seasons when ripe, fresh fruits are obtainable.</p>

<p>The cake part for a fruit short cake may be
made from any one of the following receipts:</p>

half, and roll out to the size of breakfast-plates;
lay on a greased baking-tin (<a href="#fig_14">fig. XIV</a>), and
bake in hot oven 20 minutes; separate the

<p class="noindent drop-cap"><span class="uc">These</span> old-fashioned “fried cakes,” as
they used to be called, need the addition
of Royal Baking Powder to make them
light. By its use less shortening is necessary
and the cakes are more tender and far more
digestible. After it is mixed with the flour
the other ingredients are added and the dough
quickly rolled out, cut, and at once cooked.
The fat should be in a deep pot (to obviate any
danger of boiling over), and should be of sufficient
depth to cover the dough when first
dropped in. It should be smoking hot, or the
dough will absorb grease and be soggy. Not
more than half a dozen should be dropped in
at one time, or the fat will be unduly cooled
and some of the cakes submerged during the
entire cooking; in which case the cakes when
cooked will be greasy and not light. One
or two pieces of dough should be cooked first
as testers. When done the cakes should be
drained on unglazed paper, then rolled in powdered
sugar.</p>

<p class="noindent drop-cap"><b><span class="uc">Apple Dumplings, Royal.</span></b>—1 quart
flour, thoroughly mix with it 3 teaspoons
Royal Baking Powder and a small teaspoon
salt; rub in a piece of butter or lard
the size of an egg, and then add 1 medium potato,
grated in the flour; after the butter is
well mixed, stir in milk and knead to the consistency
of soft biscuit-dough; break off pieces
of dough large enough to close over 4 quarters
of an apple (or other fruit as desired) without
rolling, and lay in an earthen dish and steam
until the fruit is tender. Serve with brandy
sauce.</p>


<p><b>Apple Dumplings, 2.</b>—Paste, 2; 6 apples,
peeled, cored, and sliced, 1 cup sugar. Line
6 cups, well greased, with the paste rolled out
thin, wet edges, fill with apples, some of the
sugar, cover with more paste; put in shallow
stewpan, large enough to contain them,
with boiling water to reach half-way up the
cups; steam thus 45 minutes; turn out on
dish, sift sugar over them; serve with spice
sauce.</p>


<p><b>Apple Dumplings, 3.</b>—Paste, 3; 8 apples,
peeled and cored, 1 cup sugar. Roll out the
paste thin, cut into 8 squares of 4 inches,

made by removing core, wet four corners of
paste, and bring them to top of apple and fasten;
sift sugar over them; lay on baking-sheet
and bake in hot oven 25 minutes; serve with
hard sauce.</p>


<p><b>Berry Dumplings.</b>—Use berries of any
kind carefully picked, hulled or prepared, and
make as for apple dumplings, putting 1 or
2 tablespoons of berries in each dumpling.</p>


<p><b>English Dumpling.</b>—1 pint flour, 1 cup
finely chopped suet, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon
Royal Baking Powder. Mix and sift flour, salt,
and baking powder. Add suet; mix to firm
dough with ice-water. Knead for 2 minutes;
roll out ½ inch thick. Put a floured cloth over
a bowl; on it spread the crust. Fill with
sliced apples mixed with sugar and a little
powdered cinnamon. Draw up crust and cloth
so as to completely cover apples; tie cloth, allowing
a little room to swell. Drop in kettle
of rapidly boiling water, with trivet at bottom
to prevent scorching. Keep at a rapid boil for
2 hours. If water stops boiling the dumpling
will be heavy. Or place in steamer and steam
3 hours. Serve hot with cream and sugar or a
liquid sauce.</p>


<p><b>Farina Dumplings.</b>—1 quart milk, 10 ounces
farina, 3 eggs, 1½ teaspoons Royal Baking
Powder, a tablespoon fresh butter, ½ pound
flour. Bring milk to a boil, stir in farina, and
boil till well done, continually stirring. After
cooling, stir in the melted butter and eggs
previously beaten up, and last add flour sifted
with baking powder and salt. Drop with tablespoon
into boiling water, well salted; boil
about 15 minutes till they rise; take out with
skimmer and serve with fruit sauce.</p>


<p><b>Peach Dumplings.</b>—Proceed as directed
for apple dumplings, 1.</p>


<p><b>Peach Dumplings, 2.</b>—Bring 1 cup water,
2 tablespoons butter, to boiling point; turn in
quickly 1 cup dry flour; stir till mixture draws
away from sides of pan. Take from fire and
cool. Work in 4 eggs, ⅔ cup flour mixed with
½ teaspoon Royal Baking Powder, more flour
if necessary to make a soft dough. Pat out in
a cake, cut in rounds with a saucer. On each
place a pared, unpitted peach. Draw dough
round to cover the fruit. Place in greased
pan, brush with milk, and bake 30 minutes in
moderate oven. Serve with clear sauce.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Receipts for making dumplings for a stew
or fricassee frequently call for shortening.
This is a mistake, and usually results in
heavy, soggy dumplings. Heaviness may also
be caused by a removal of the lid of pot or
steamer before the dumplings are done. Flour,
salt, Royal Baking Powder, and sweet milk
are all that are needed to make tender, fluffy
dumplings of this kind. The dry ingredients
should be sifted carefully together, then quickly
mixed with the milk. During the cooking the
liquid in pot or steamer should be kept at a
steady boil. No more batter or dough should
be dropped in at one time than will cover the
surface of the liquid or rest on top of the meat,
for, if too many dumplings are dropped in at
once, those underneath are sure to be soggy.
The cover should not be lifted until the dumplings
are done.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Pies">Pies</h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent drop-cap"><span class="uc">The</span> richest pastry for pies is called puff
paste, and much skill and practice
are required to make it flaky, tender,
and very light. First-class puff paste will rise
in baking to double its thickness and be in
light, flaky layers and without greasiness. The
novice must learn to handle it as lightly and
little as possible in rolling and turning. It
should be put in the ice-box as soon as made
and stand at least twelve hours before being
used.</p>

<p>Pastry flour should always be used for pie
crust. It is whiter than bread flour and when
rubbed between the fingers it feels very smooth
and soft, like corn-starch. Carefully sift before
using.</p>

<p>Where it is desired to have a plainer pastry,
or one less troublesome to make and more
economical, the use of a small quantity of
Royal Baking Powder will give a light and
tender crust. As in other cases, the baking
powder must be mixed and sifted with the
flour before the shortening is added. Sweet
home-made lard may be used in place of butter,
either wholly or in part, giving a less expensive
but equally good and light paste. Never
use sour milk or so-called prepared or self-raising
flours.</p>


<p><b>Paste for Pies.</b>—3 cups sifted flour, ½ teaspoon
Royal Baking Powder, large pinch salt,
1 cup cream, ½ cup butter. Sift flour, salt,
and powder together; add the cream; mix
into smooth, rather firm paste; flour the board,
roll it out thin; spread the butter on it evenly,
fold in three; roll out thin, and fold in three;
repeat twice more and use.</p>


<p><b>Paste, 2.</b>—3 cups flour, ½ teaspoon Royal
Baking Powder, ½ pound beef suet, freed of
skin and chopped very fine, 1 cup water.
Place the flour, sifted with the powder, in
bowl; add suet and water; mix into smooth,
rather firm dough.</p>


<p><b>Paste, 3.</b>—3 cups sifted flour, ½ cup lard,
1½ cups butter, ½ teaspoon Royal Baking
Powder, 1 cup water. Cut lard into flour,
sifted with powder; mix into smooth, firm
paste with the water; place it to cool for 15
minutes; meanwhile press milk and salt from
butter by pressing in clean, wet towel, and
flour it. Roll out dough on well-floured board;
place butter on it; fold dough over it, completely
covering butter; roll it out lightly to
½ inch in thickness, turn it over, fold each
end to middle, flour it, roll out again; fold
ends to middle, and turn it; repeat this 3
times more, and use. If this paste is made in
summer, put on ice after each operation of
folding and rolling.</p>


<p><b>Paste, 4.</b>—5 cups flour, 1 cup butter, 1 cup
lard, 1 cup water, ½ teaspoon Royal Baking
Powder. Sift flour with powder; rub in lard
and butter cold; add the water; mix into a
smooth, lithe dough.</p>


<p><b>Paste, 5 (Puff Paste).</b>—3 cups sifted flour,
2 cups butter, 1 egg yolk, a little salt. This is
difficult to make. The essentials are: A cool
place to make it in, ice broken up in 2 shallow
cake pans, good flour, and butter, firm, with
salt and buttermilk worked out. Sift flour on
pastry slab, form it in a ring with back of
your hand. Place in center the egg yolk and
salt; add a little ice-water, and from inside of
ring gradually take flour, adding a little at a
time, as you require it, more ice-water, about a
cup altogether, until you have smooth, fine
paste, very tenacious and lithe. Place in ice-box
15 minutes, then roll out to size of a dinner-plate;
lay on it butter, and wrap over it
edges of dough, carefully covering it; turn it
upside down, roll out very thin; then turn
face down—the face is side of paste next to
rolling-pin—folding it in three, squarely; repeat
this <em>three times more</em>, placing it in thin tin
on the broken ice, and other tin containing
ice <em>on it</em>, after each turn or operation of folding
and rolling. By this method this difficult
puff paste may be made successfully in
hottest weather.</p>


<p><b>Paste, 6.</b>—3 cups sifted flour, 1 large cup
butter, ½ teaspoon Royal Baking Powder, 3
tablespoons sugar, ½ cup milk. Sift flour
with powder and sugar, rub in butter, add
milk; mix into a smooth dough of medium
stiffness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span></p>


<p><b>Apple Pot-Pie.</b>—14 apples, peeled, cored,
and sliced, 1½ pints flour, 1 teaspoon Royal
Baking Powder, 1 cup sugar, ½ cup butter, 1
cup milk, large pinch salt. Sift flour with
powder and salt, rub in butter cold, add milk,
mix into dough as for tea biscuits; with it line
shallow stewpan to within 2 inches of bottom;
pour in 1½ cups water, apples, and sugar; wet
edges and cover with rest of dough; put cover
on, set it to boil 20 minutes, then place in
moderate oven until apples are cooked; then
remove from oven, cut top crust in four equal
parts; dish apples, lay on them pieces of side
crust cut in diamonds, and pieces of top crust
on a plate; serve with cream.</p>


<p><b>Apple Pie.</b>—5 or 6 apples, 1 cup sugar, ⅓
cup water, 1 teaspoon extract lemon, paste,
4. Peel, quarter, and core apples, put in stewpan
with sugar and water; when tender, remove;
when cold, add extract and fill pie-plate,
lined with paste; wet the edges, cover with
paste rolled out thin, and wash with milk;
bake in steady, moderate oven 20 minutes.</p>


<p><b>Apple Pie, 2.</b>—3 tart apples, ½ cup sugar,
½ lemon rind grated, paste, 4. Peel, core, and
slice apples very thin; line pie-plate with paste;
put in apples, sugar, and little water; wet the
edges, cover with paste rolled out very thin;
wash with milk; bake in steady, moderate
oven 25 minutes—or till apples are cooked.</p>


<p><b>Dried Apple Pie.</b>—Stew apples until quite
soft; rub through a colander; have them juicy.
Beat 2 eggs, saving the white of 1; ½ cup
butter, ½ cup sugar to every pie; season to

form, can make this addition to a common
custard pie. Beat 1 egg to a stiff froth, then
add pulverized sugar and grated chocolate
with ½ teaspoon extract vanilla; spread this
on the top of the pie and let it harden for a
moment in the oven. Or you may prepare it
in still another way. Put the chocolate in a

<p><b>Preserving.</b>—Preserves require from ¾ to
1 pound of sugar to each pound of fruit, and
½ cup water to each pound sugar. The fruit
should be simmered in the syrup until tender,
a little at a time; skimmed out into the jars;
when all are done the syrup should be brought
to boiling point, jars filled and sealed. Hard
fruits like quinces should be first steamed or
cooked in boiling water till tender.</p>


<p><b>Jams.</b>—Jams are usually made with small
fruits or with chopped large fruits; they are
cooked with an equal weight of sugar till rich
and thick, then put into tumblers or small
jars and sealed.</p>


<p><b>Jellies.</b>—Use equal parts of sugar and
drained fruit juice. Mash and heat berries
till juice runs readily, then turn into bags of
unbleached muslin or 2 thicknesses of cheese-cloth
and let drip. Measure juice and sugar.
Boil juice 20 minutes. Have sugar in shallow
pan, heat through in open oven. Add to boiling
juice, boil up once, take off fire and pour
into tumblers. Fruit like apples and quinces
should be chopped and covered with water,
then simmered till tender before turning into
jelly-bags.</p>


<p><b>Spiced Fruits.</b>—These are also called sweet
pickled fruits. For 4 pounds prepared fruit
allow 1 pint vinegar, 2 pounds brown sugar,
½ cup whole spices—cloves, allspice, stick cinnamon,
and cassia-buds. Tie spices in thin
muslin bag, boil 10 minutes with vinegar and
sugar. Skim, add fruit, cook till tender. Boil
down syrup, pour over fruit in jars, and seal.
If put in stone pots, boil syrup 3 successive
mornings and pour over fruit. Currants,
peaches, grapes, pears, and berries may be
prepared in this way, also ripe cucumbers,
muskmelons, and watermelon rind.</p>

of hot water to cook, covered, 2 hours more.
Heat the rest and skim; put in sago, simmer
for ½ hour, then pour out. When 2 hours<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
have passed, pour out stock in bowl; when
cold put on ice.</p>


<p><b>Bean Soup.</b>—Soak quart white beans overnight;
in morning pour off water; add fresh,
and set over fire until skins will easily slip off;
throw them into cold water, rub well, and
skins will rise to top, where they may be removed.
Boil beans till perfectly soft, allowing
2 quarts water to 1 quart beans; mash beans,
add flour and butter rubbed together, also salt
and pepper. Cut cold bread into small pieces,
toast, and drop on soup when you serve.</p>


<p><b>Family Soup.</b>—Time, 6 hours; 3 or 4 quarts
pot liquor, <i>i. e.</i>, the water in which mutton or
salt beef has been boiled. Any bones from
dressed meat, trimmings of poultry, scraps of
meat or 1 pound gravy beef, 2 large onions, 1
turnip, 2 carrots, a little celery seed tied in a
piece muslin, bunch savory herbs, 1 sprig parsley,
5 cloves, 2 blades mace, a few peppercorns,
pepper and salt to taste. Put all your meat-trimmings,
meat-bones, etc., into stewpan.
Stick onions with cloves, add them with other
vegetables to meat; pour over all the pot liquor;
set over slow fire and let simmer gently,
removing all scum as it rises. Strain through
fine hair-sieve.</p>


<p><b>Clam Soup.</b>—Boil juice of clams, make a
little drawn butter and mix with the juice; stir
till it boils, chop up clams and put them in;
season to taste with pepper, salt, and little
lemon juice; cream or milk is to be added. Boil
over slow fire 1 hour.</p>


<p><b>Soups of Dried Peas or Beans.</b>—Pick and
soak split peas, dried green peas, or black or
white beans overnight. Drain, measure, add
4 times as much cold water; to each quart of
water, ½ onion. Simmer slowly till soft. Rub
through sieve. Return to fire, season with
salt and pepper; for each quart thicken with 1
teaspoon each butter and flour. Boil up again
for a few minutes. Black bean soup should
also have a pinch of mustard and a little lemon
juice added, and slices of hard-boiled egg.</p>


<p><b>Croutons.</b>—Trim crust from stale bread and
cut in ½-inch dice. Fry golden brown in a
little butter or in a kettle of smoking-hot fat.
Drain and serve hot with soups. Instead of
frying they may be browned in the oven.</p>


<p><b>Ox-tail Soup.</b>—1 ox-tail, 2 pounds lean beef,
4 carrots, 3 onions, thyme and parsley, pepper
and salt to taste, 4 quarts cold water. Cut tail
into joints, fry brown in good dripping. Slice
onions and 2 carrots and fry in the same, when
you have taken out the pieces of tail. When
done tie the thyme and parsley in lace bag,
and drop into the soup-pot. Put in the tail,
then the beef cut into strips. Grate over
them 2 whole carrots, pour over all the water,
and boil slowly 4 hours; strain and season;
thicken with brown flour wet with cold water;
boil 15 minutes longer and serve.</p>

</div>


<p class="noindent drop-cap"><b><span class="uc">Directions for Preparing.</span></b>—Clean
fish carefully, slit it low enough so as
not to have any blood on the backbone,
but do not make too large a cut so as to spoil
look of fish; wash thoroughly in cold water.
<em>Great care</em> must be taken not to break gall, for
it would make fish bitter. Use good dripping
or lard for frying.</p>


<p><b>To Broil Fish.</b>—Clean, wash, and wipe dry.
Split so that when laid flat the backbone will
be in the middle, or take the backbone out.
Sprinkle with salt and lay, inside down, upon
a buttered gridiron over a clear fire until it is
nicely colored, then turn. When done, put
upon a hot dish, butter plentifully, and pepper.
Put a hot cover over it and send to table.</p>


<p><b>Boiled Bass, or other Fish.</b>—Put sufficient
water in pot to enable fish, if alive, to swim
easily. Add ½ cup vinegar, 1 teaspoon salt,
1 onion, 1 dozen whole black peppers, 1 blade
mace. Sew up fish in piece of clean net or
muslin, fitted to shape. Heat slowly for first
½ hour; then boil 8 minutes, at least, to
pound, quite fast. Unwrap, and pour over it
cup of drawn butter, based upon the liquor in
which fish was boiled, with juice of ½ lemon
stirred into it.</p>


<p><b>Creamed Fish.</b>—Steam 2 pounds codfish,
break in flakes, removing bones and skin.
Make 1 pint white sauce (see <a href="#Meat_and_Fish_Sauces">Meat and Fish
Sauces</a>). Grease a baking-dish, fill with alternate
layers of fish and sauce, seasoning with
salt, pepper, chopped parsley, and lemon juice
or a few drops of vinegar. Mix together 1 cup
dry bread crumbs and 3 tablespoons melted
butter; spread over top and brown in quick
oven.</p>

<p>This may be varied by using tomato, bechamel,
curry, or any other sauce, or by adding
grated cheese or sliced hard-boiled eggs to the
white sauce; by baking in shells or patty-pans
in place of the deep dish, or by covering with
mashed potato or biscuit crust instead of
crumbs.</p>


<p><b>Broiled Salt Mackerel.</b>—Freshen by soaking
it overnight in water, taking care that the
skin lies uppermost. In the morning dry it
without breaking, cut off the head and tip of
the tail, place it between the bars of a buttered
fish-gridiron, and broil to a light brown; lay it
on a hot dish, and dress with a little butter,
pepper, and lemon juice, vinegar, or chopped
pickle.</p>


<p><b>Broiled Halibut.</b>—Slices of halibut, salt,
pepper, butter. Cut the slices of fish about an
inch thick, season with pepper and salt, and
lay them in melted butter ½ hour, allowing 3
tablespoons of butter to a pound of fish, then
roll them in flour, and broil about 20 minutes.
Serve very hot.</p>


<p><b>Codfish Balls.</b>—Put fish in cold water, set
on back of stove; when water gets hot, pour
off and put on cold again until fish is fresh
enough; then pick it up. Boil potatoes and
mash them; mix fish and potatoes together
while potatoes are hot, taking ⅔ potatoes and
⅓ fish. Put in plenty of butter; make into
balls and fry in plenty of lard. Have lard hot
before putting in balls.</p>

<p>Variation may be had by rolling each ball
in beaten egg, then in dry bread crumbs before
frying.</p>


<p><b>Fried Blue Fish, and other Kinds.</b>—Clean,
wipe dry, inside and out. Sprinkle with flour,
and season with salt. Fry in hot butter or
sweet lard. ½ lard and ½ butter make a good
mixture for frying fish. The moment fish are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
done to good brown, take them from fat and
drain in hot strainer; garnish with parsley.</p>


<p><b>Fish Chowder.</b>—Cut 2 or 3 slices of salt pork
into dice pieces; fry to crisp, and turn the
whole into chowder-kettle. Pare 6 medium-sized
potatoes and cut them in two. Peel small
onion and chop fine. Put potatoes into kettle
with part of onion. Cut fish (which should be
fresh cod or haddock) into convenient pieces,
and lay over potatoes; sprinkle over it rest of
the onion. Season well with salt and pepper,
add just enough water to come to top of fish.
Pour over the whole quart can tomatoes;
cover closely and allow to cook about as long
as takes to boil potatoes; then add 2 quarts
milk, and let it scald up again. Season with
tomato catsup, and more salt and pepper if
required.</p>


<p><b>To Fry Brook Trout or any other Small
Fish.</b>—Clean fish, and let them lie few minutes
wrapped singly in clean dry towel; season
with pepper and salt; roll in corn meal, fry in
⅓ butter and ⅔ lard; drain on sieve, and
serve hot.</p>

<p class="noindent drop-cap"><b><span class="uc">Clam Chowder.</span></b>—25 clams cut up, ½
pound salt pork chopped fine, 6 potatoes
sliced thin, 4 onions sliced thin. Put
pork in kettle; after cooking a short time add
potatoes, onions, and juice of clams. Cook
2½ hours, then add clams; 15 minutes before
serving add 2 quarts milk.</p>


<p><b>Fried Oysters.</b>—Select largest and finest
oysters. Drain and wipe them by spreading
upon cloth, laying another over them,
pressing lightly. Roll each in beaten egg,
then in cracker crumbs with which has been
mixed a very little pepper. Fry in mixture of
equal parts of lard and butter.</p>


<p><b>Oysters Roasted in the Shell.</b>—Wash and
scrub the shells. Cook in hot oven, on top of
stove, over red-hot coals, or in steamer until
shells open. Always place them round shell
down to retain juice. Serve melted butter and
vinegar or lemons with them.</p>


<p><b>Panned Oysters.</b>—Pick over the opened
oysters to remove bits of shell. Wash quickly
in cold water and drain on sieve. Put into
saucepan with 1 tablespoon butter for 25 oysters
and a dash of salt and pepper. Cover
and shake over a hot fire until edges ruffle
and oysters are plump. May be served on toast.</p>


<p><b>Stewed Oysters.</b>—Pick over and wash 1
quart oysters. Scald 1 pint milk. Strain, boil,
and skim oyster liquor; when clear add oysters.
Cook till oysters are plump and well ruffled;
take from fire, add hot milk, salt, and pepper.</p>

<p>If desired thicker, rub together 1 tablespoon
each of butter and flour; add to milk and stir
until smooth. This may be varied by addition
of a little chopped celery or onion.</p>


<p><b>Creamed Oysters.</b>—Prepare 1 cup thick
cream sauce (see <a href="#Meat_and_Fish_Sauces">Sauces</a>). Pan 1 pint cleaned
oysters; drain and add to sauce. Season with
salt, pepper, pinch of mace, and few drops
lemon juice.</p>


<p><b>Scalloped Oysters.</b>—Pick, wash, and drain
1 solid quart oysters. Put in layers in baking-dish, 
alternating with dry bread or cracker
crumbs and seasoning. When dish is filled add
strained oyster liquor and sufficient milk to
moisten. Cover with crumbs, add 1 tablespoon
butter in bits, and bake ½ hour in hot oven.</p>


<p><b>Broiled Oysters.</b>—Pick, wash, and drain
large oysters. Dip each in melted butter, roll
in fine crumbs, and broil in fine wire broiler
over a clear, hot fire. Serve on toast with
sliced lemons.</p>


<p><b>Pickled Oysters.</b>—2 gallons large oysters,
drain and rinse them; put 1 pint oyster juice
in 1 quart vinegar over fire; scald and skim
until clear; add 1 tablespoon whole pepper, 1
tablespoon cloves, 1 tablespoon mace, 1 even
tablespoon salt; scald a minute, then throw in
oysters; let them just come to a boil. The
oysters should be pickled day before being
wanted, as they grow tough after standing a
few days in vinegar.</p>


<p><b>Oyster Pâtés.</b>—1 quart oysters, minced fine
with a sharp knife; 1 cup rich drawn butter
based upon milk; cayenne and black pepper to
taste. Stir minced oysters in drawn butter
and cook 5 minutes. Have ready some shapes
of pastry, baked in pâté-pans, then slipped out.
Fill these with the mixture; set in oven 2 minutes
to heat, and send to table.</p>


<p><b>Oyster Pie.</b>—1 quart oysters, drained; pepper,
salt, and butter to taste. 1 quart flour, 2
tablespoons lard, 1 tablespoon salt, mix with

pie-plate with crust; fill with oysters, seasoned;
put over a crust and bake.</p>


<p><b>Scallops in Batter.</b>—Wash and dry large
scallops. Dip each in fritter batter (see <a href="#Fritters_and_Waffles">Fritters</a>)
and fry golden brown in smoking-hot fat.</p>


<p><b>To Boil Lobsters or Crabs.</b>—The lobster is
in good season from April to December, and
should be purchased alive and plunged into
boiling water in which a good proportion of
salt has been mixed. Continue to boil according
to size about 20 minutes. Crabs should be
boiled in the same manner, but a little more
than half the time is necessary.</p>


<p><b>Deviled Crabs.</b>—1 cup crab meat, picked
from shells of well-boiled crabs, 2 tablespoons
fine bread crumbs or rolled cracker, yolks two
hard-boiled eggs chopped, juice of a lemon, ½
teaspoon mustard, a little cayenne pepper and
salt, 1 cup good drawn butter. Mix 1 spoon
crumbs with chopped crab meat, yolks, seasoning,
drawn butter. Fill scallop shells—large
clam shells will do—or small pâté-pans—with
the mixture; sift crumbs over top, heat to
slight browning in quick oven.</p>


<p><b>Soft Shell Crabs.</b>—Fry in butter or lard.</p>


<p><b>To Open a Boiled Lobster.</b>—Wipe off shell,
break off large claws; separate tail from body;
take body from shell, leaving “lady,” or
stomach, on shell. Put aside green fat and coral;
remove small claws; remove woolly gills from
body, break latter through middle, and pick out
meat from joints. Crush or cut under side of
tail, draw meat from shell. Draw back flesh
on upper end and pull off intestinal cord.
Break edge of large claws and remove meat.</p>


<p><b>Lobster Newburg.</b>—Season 1 pint diced
lobster with ½ teaspoon salt, dash cayenne,
pinch nutmeg. Put in saucepan with 2 tablespoons

</div>


<h3>Broiling</h3>

<p class="noindent drop-cap"><span class="uc">The</span> rules for roasting meat apply to broiling,
except that instead of cooking it in
the oven it is to be quickly browned,
first on one side and then on the other, over a
hot fire, and removed a little from the fire to
finish cooking. Meat an inch thick will broil
in about 4 minutes. It should be seasoned
after it is cooked.</p>


<h3>Frying</h3>

<p>There are two distinct methods of frying:
One with very little fat in the pan, to practise
which successfully the pan and the fat must
be hot before the article to be fried is put into
it. For instance, in frying chops, if the pan
is hot, and only fat enough is used to keep the
chops from sticking to it, the heat being maintained
so that the chops cook quickly, they
will be nearly as nice as if they were broiled.
Frying by the other method consists in entirely
immersing the article to be cooked in sufficient
smoking-hot fat to cover it, and keeping the
fat at that degree of heat until the food is
brown. It should then be taken up with a
skimmer and laid upon brown paper for a moment
to free it from grease.</p>


<h3>Boiling and Stewing</h3>

<p>Fresh meat for boiling should be put into
boiling water and boiled very gently about 20
minutes for each pound. A little salt, spice,
or vegetables may be boiled in the water with
the meat for seasoning. A little vinegar put
in the water with tough meat makes it tender.
The broth of boiled meat should always be
saved to use in soups, stews, and gravies.
Stewing and simmering meats means to place
them near enough to the fire to keep the water
on them bubbling moderately, constantly, and
slowly. Salt meats should be put over the fire
in cold water, which as soon as it boils should
be replaced by fresh cold water, the water to
be changed until it remains fresh enough to
give the meat a palatable flavor when done.
Salted and smoked meats require about 30
minutes’ very slow boiling, from the time the
water boils, to each pound. Vegetables and
herbs may be boiled with them to flavor them.
When they are cooked the vessel containing
them should be set where they will keep hot
without boiling until required, if they are to
be served hot; if they are to be served cold,
they should be allowed to cool in the pot liquor
in which they were boiled. Very salt meats,
or those much dried in smoking, should be
soaked overnight in cold water before boiling.</p>


<h3>Roasting</h3>

<p>Wipe meat with damp cloth. Trim and tie
into shape if necessary. In the bottom of pan
put some pieces of fat from meat. Arrange
meat on rack in pan. Dredge with salt, pepper,
and flour. Have oven <em>very</em> hot at first;
when meat is half done reduce heat. Baste
every 10 or 15 minutes. If there is danger
of fat in pan being scorched add a few spoons
of boiling water. Allow from 10 to 20 minutes
per pound of meat, according as it is desired
rare or well done. When done remove to hot
platter. Thicken gravy in pan with browned
flour, adding more water as necessary and add
seasoning.</p>


<p><b>Yorkshire Pudding.</b>-¾ pint flour, 3 eggs,
1½ pints milk, pinch salt, 1½ teaspoons Royal
Baking Powder. Sift flour and powder together,
add eggs, beaten with milk, stir quickly
into rather thinner batter than for griddle
cakes, pour into dripping-pan, plentifully
greased with beef-dripping, bake in hot oven
25 minutes; serve with roast beef.</p>


<p><b>Braised Beef.</b>—Wipe and trim 6 pounds
round or rump of beef without bone. Sear
brown on all sides in very hot frying-pan over
hot fire. In braising-pan or iron kettle put
layers of sliced onions, turnips, and carrots;
add bunch of sweet herbs, 1 teaspoon salt, ½
teaspoon pepper; on this lay meat. Add 1 pint
boiling water (or water and stewed tomatoes).
Cover closely and cook 4 hours in moderate
oven. If water evaporates rapidly add more.
Transfer meat to hot platter. Strain, thicken,
and season gravy. The vegetables may be
served separately if desired.</p>


<p><b>Braised Veal Shoulder.</b>—Have shoulder
boned. Fill with stuffing (see <a href="#Stuffings">Stuffings</a>). Prepare
bed of vegetables as for braised beef.
Lay veal on it, add 1 pint boiling water, 1 pint
stewed tomatoes, ½ teaspoon salt, ¼ teaspoon
pepper. Cover and cook 4 hours in moderate
oven. Uncover and brown. Serve strained
gravy separately.</p>


<p><b>Broiled Steak.</b>—Trim and wipe steak, which
should be at least 1 inch thick. Rub broiler
with fat, arrange steak with thickest part in
center of broiler. Have fire clear and very
hot, but without blaze. Hold steak close to fire.
Turn every ½ minute, that it may sear quickly.
When ½ done season with salt and pepper.
Steak 1 inch thick will broil in 4 minutes.</p>


<p><b>Panned Steak or Chops.</b>—Trim and wipe
steak. Heat frying-pan until it smokes all
over. Rub bottom with a bit of fat. Lay in
steak and turn every 10 seconds. Keep pan
<em>very</em> hot. Season when ½ done.</p>

<p>Mutton and pork chops, ham and bacon, may
be panned in same way.</p>

<p>If hot platter for steak is rubbed with a cut
onion it will give a delightful flavor to the meat.</p>


<p><b>Broiled Ham and Poached Eggs.</b>—Cut
slices of boiled ham of equal size; broil on a
gridiron over a clear fire; lay on a hot dish.
Lay on each a poached egg, neatly trimmed,
and serve.</p>


<p><b>Beefsteak Pie (French style).</b>—Take a
nice piece of beef, rump or sirloin, cut in small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
slices; slice also a little raw ham; put both in
a frying-pan, with some butter and small quantity
chopped onions; let them simmer together
a short time on the fire or in the oven; add a
little flour and enough stock to make sauce;
salt, pepper, chopped parsley, and a little Worcestershire
sauce as seasoning; add also a few
sliced potatoes, and cook together for about 20
minutes; put this into a pie-dish, with a few
slices of hard-boiled eggs on the top, and cover
with a layer of common paste. Bake from 15
to 20 minutes in a well-heated oven. All dark-meat
pies can be treated precisely in the same
way. If poultry, leave the potatoes out.</p>


<p><b>To Boil a Ham.</b>—A blade of mace, a few
cloves, a sprig of thyme, and 2 bay-leaves. Well
soak ham in large quantity of water for 24
hours, then trim and scrape very clean; put
into large stewpan, with more than sufficient
water to cover it; put in mace, cloves, thyme,
and bay-leaves. Boil 4 or 5 hours, according
to weight; when done, let it become cold in
liquor in which it was boiled. Then remove
rind carefully, without injuring the fat; press
cloth over it to absorb as much of the grease
as possible. It is always improved by setting
in the oven for nearly an hour, till much of
the fat dries out, and it also makes it more
tender. Shake some bread raspings over the
fat. Serve cold garnished with parsley.</p>


<p><b>Boiled Mutton or Lamb.</b>—Trim and wipe
the meat. Have ready kettle of rapidly boiling
salted water. Immerse meat, boil hard 5 minutes,
then reduce to gentle simmer. Allow 12
to 15 minutes per pound. Lamb should always
be well done; mutton may be rare. A little
rice may be added to water to keep meat white;
if a few vegetables are also added the pot liquor
will make a good thick soup.</p>


<p><b>Boiled Corned Beef and Turnips.</b>—Select a
piece not too salt. The brisket is a good cut
for family use when not too fat. Cook beef in
plenty cold water. Bring slowly to boil. Cook
18 minutes to the pound after it begins to simmer.
When fully ¾ done put in a dozen turnips,
peeled and quartered. When both beef
and turnips are thoroughly done dish out the
beef, and lay the turnips, unmashed, about it.
Serve with drawn butter, having as a base the
pot liquor. Remaining liquor will make a good
soup for next day’s dinner.</p>


<p><b>Pork Chops with Tomato Gravy.</b>—Trim
off skin and fat; rub the chops over with a
mixture of powdered sage and onion; put
small piece butter into a frying-pan; put in
the chops and cook slowly, as they should be
well done. Lay chops on hot dish; add a little
hot water to gravy in pan, 1 large spoon
butter rolled in flour, pepper, salt, and sugar,
and ½ cup juice drained from can tomatoes.
The tomatoes themselves can be used for a
tomato omelet. Stew 5 minutes and pour over
the chops and serve.</p>


<p><b>Sausages.</b>—Have ¾ lean and ¼ fat pork
chopped very fine, 1 pound salt, ¼ pound
pepper, and tea-cup sage to every 40 pounds
meat. Warm the meat, that you can mix it
well with your hands, do up a part in small
patties mixed with a little flour, the rest pack
in jars. When to be used, do it up in small
cakes, flour the outside, fry in butter or alone.
They should not be covered while frying, or
they will fall to pieces. They should be kept
where it is cool, but not damp. To prevent
sausages from bursting when cooking, never
make a hole in them with a fork while turning
them.</p>


<p><b>Fried Salt Pork.</b>—Cut fat salt pork in thin
slices and soak in milk for a few hours. Pour
boiling water over, drain, and fry until crisp.
When partly fried they may be dipped into
batter (see <a href="#Fritters_and_Waffles">Fritters</a>), then finished in the same
pan, turning several times.</p>


<p><b>Pork and Beans.</b>—Soak 1 quart white beans
overnight in cold water. Drain, add fresh
water, and simmer gently till tender. Put in
baking-pan and place in center, rind up, gashed,
½ pound fat salt pork parboiled. Mix 1 teaspoon
salt, ½ teaspoon dry mustard, and 1 tablespoon
molasses; add to the beans, with enough
boiling water to cover. Bake 8 hours in a
moderate oven, adding more water as necessary.</p>


<p><b>Liver and Bacon.</b>—Cut liver in ½-inch
slices, soak in cold water 20 minutes, drain,
dry, and roll in flour. Have pan very hot. Put
in bacon thinly sliced, turn until brown, transfer
to hot platter. Fry liver quickly in the
hot fat, turning often. When done pour off
all but 1 or 2 tablespoons fat, dredge in flour
until it is absorbed, and stir till brown. Add
hot water gradually to make smooth gravy,
season and boil 1 minute. Serve separately.</p>

<p>Few people know that lamb’s liver is as tender
and well flavored as calf’s liver; it is much
less expensive.</p>


<p><b>Stew, Irish.</b>—Time, about 2 hours. 2½
pounds chops, 8 potatoes, 4 turnips, 4 small
onions, nearly a quart of water. Take some
chops from loin of mutton, place them in a
stewpan in alternate layers of sliced potatoes
and chops; add turnips and onions cut into
pieces, pour in nearly quart cold water; cover
stewpan closely, let stew gently till vegetables
are ready to mash and greater part of gravy is
absorbed; then place in a dish; serve it up
hot.</p>


<p><b>Brown Beef Stew.</b>—Cut 2 pounds beef in
small pieces. Melt some of the fat in a pan,
brown in it ½ the meat. Put rest of meat in
kettle with 1 pint cold water, let stand 20 minutes,
then heat slowly. Transfer browned
meat to kettle; thicken fat with two tablespoons
browned flour, add 1 pint boiling water
and stir; when thick strain into kettle. Add
1 cup diced carrot, cover, and simmer. When
half done add 1 pint diced potatoes. Season
well with salt and pepper.</p>


<p><b>Mutton Haricot.</b>—Cut 2 pounds breast
mutton in pieces, roll in flour, and brown in
drippings. Transfer to a stewpan, 
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: and" id="and"> add</ins>
 2 sliced
onions, cover with boiling water, and simmer
until very tender. Add 1 pint parboiled potatoes
or 1 pint boiled macaroni and 1 pint
shelled peas; season, simmer till vegetables
are done.</p>


<p><b>Brown Kidney Stew.</b>—From a beef kidney
cut off the outside meat in bits, rejecting tubes
and purplish cores. Cover with cold water;

<p class="noindent drop-cap"><b><span class="uc">To Clean Poultry.</span></b>—Put 2 tablespoons
alcohol in saucer, ignite, and
over this singe the fowl. Cut off head
just below bill. Untie feet, break bone, and
loosen sinews just <em>below</em> the joint; pull out sinews
and cut off feet. Cut out oil-sac. Lay
breast down, slit skin down backbone toward
head; loosen windpipe and crop and pull
them out. Cut off neck close to body. Make

Cut round the vent so that the intestines are
unbroken. Remove heart and lungs. Remove
kidneys. See that inside looks clean,
then wipe out with wet cloth. Wipe off skin
with cloth.</p>


<p><b>To Truss Poultry.</b>—Fill inside with stuffing
(see <a href="#Stuffings">Stuffings</a>). Have at least 1 yard fine
twine in trussing-needle. Turn wings across
back so that pinions touch. Run needle
through thick part of wing <em>under</em> bone, through
body and wing on other side; return in same
way, but passing needle in <em>over</em> bone, tie firmly,
leave several inches of twine. Press legs up
against body, run needle through thigh, body,
and second thigh, and return, going round
bone in same way; tie firmly. Run needle
through ends of legs, return, passing needle
through rump; if opening is badly torn, 1 or 2
stitches may be needed, otherwise not.</p>


<p><b>To Roast Poultry.</b>—Rub all over with soft
butter and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Place on rack in roasting-pan and put in <em>very</em>
hot oven. Make basting-mixture with ½ cup
each of butter or chicken-fat and water; keep
hot and baste every 10 or 15 minutes. Roast 3
hours for 8-pound turkey, 1 to 1½ hours for
fowls. Keep oven very hot. If fowl is very
large and heavy, cover breast and legs with
several thicknesses paper to keep from burning.</p>


<p><b>Poultry Gravy.</b>—Pour off excess of fat in
pan. Set pan on stove and sprinkle in sufficient
flour to absorb fat. Stir until well
browned. Gradually add hot water, or the
chopped giblets with water in which they were
cooked; stir till smoothly thickened. Season,
simmer for few minutes, and serve.</p>


<p><b>Broiled Chicken.</b>—Singe, split down backbone,
and clean. Grease broiler, arrange
chicken on it, crossing legs and turning wings.
Rub inside and out with soft butter, and season.
Have fire clear and hot. Cook flesh side
first, holding up well that it may not brown too
quickly. Should cook in about 20 or 25 minutes,
then turn and brown skin side.</p>


<p><b>Fried Spring Chicken.</b>—Clean and disjoint,
then soak in salt water for 2 hours. Put in
frying-pan equal parts of lard and butter—in
all enough to cover chicken. Roll each
piece in flour, dip in beaten egg, then roll in
cracker crumbs, and drop into the boiling fat.
Fry until browned on both sides. Serve on
flat platter garnished with sprigs of parsley.
Pour most of fat from frying-pan, thicken the
remainder with browned flour, add to it cup of
boiling water or milk. Serve in gravy-boat.</p>


<p><b>Chicken Fricassee.</b>—Clean and disjoint
chicken. Wipe each piece. Put in pot, cover

thicken with flour dissolved in cold water.
Season well, boil up for a few minutes. Serve
with dumplings or Royal biscuit.</p>


<p><b>Brown Fricassee of Chicken.</b>—Clean and
disjoint. Brown in a few spoons hot butter

<p><b>Chicken Pâtés.</b>—Chop meat of cold chicken
coarsely and season well. Make large cup rich
drawn butter, and while on fire stir in 2 eggs,
boiled hard, minced very fine, also a little
chopped parsley, then chicken meat. Let almost
boil. Have ready some pâté-pans of
good paste, baked quickly to light brown. Slip
from pans while hot, fill with mixture and set
in oven to heat. Arrange upon dish and serve
hot.</p>


<p><b>Boned Chicken.</b>—Boil a chicken in little
water as possible until meat will fall from
bones; remove all skin, chop together light
and dark parts; season with pepper and salt.
Boil down liquid in which chicken was boiled,
then pour it on meat; place in tin, wrap tightly
in cloth, press with heavy weight several hours.
Serve cold, cut in thin slices.</p>


<p><b>Chicken Pot-pie.</b>—2 large chickens disjointed
and boiled in 2 quarts water; add a few
slices salt pork; season. When nearly cooked,
add crust made of 1 quart flour, 4 teaspoons
Royal Baking Powder, 1 saltspoon salt; stir in
stiff batter with water; drop into kettle while
boiling; cover close and cook 25 minutes.</p>


<p><b>Chicken Pot-pie, 2.</b>—Disjoint 2 fowls and
cook in 2 quarts water till very tender. Slip
out bones and season. Line sides of clean kettle
with rich biscuit crust (see <a href="#Hot_Biscuits_Cakes_and_Muffins">Biscuits</a>). Add
chicken and thickened liquor. Stand on moderately
hot fire. Build fire of dry cobs or small
sticks round kettle, and keep burning till crust
is well browned. Put chicken on platter and
lay crust on it. <i>Old-fashioned receipt.</i></p>

<p>Make thick dumpling batter (see <a href="#Dumplings">Dumplings</a>).
Drop by spoonfuls into thickened boiling liquor,
cover closely for 20 minutes. <i>New receipt.</i></p>


<p><b>Chicken Pie.</b>—Take 2 full-grown chickens,
or more if small, disjoint them, cut backbone,
etc., small as convenient. Boil them with few
slices of salt pork in water enough to cover
them, let boil quite tender, then take out breast-bone.
After they boil and scum is taken off,
put in a little onion out very fine—not enough
to taste distinctly, just enough to flavor a little;
rub some parsley very fine when dry, or
cut fine when green—this gives pleasant flavor.
Season well with pepper and salt, and
few ounces good fresh butter. When all is
cooked well, have liquid enough to cover
chicken, then beat 2 eggs and stir in some
sweet cream. Line 5-quart pan with crust
made like Royal Baking Powder biscuit, only
more shortening, put in chicken and liquid,
cover with crust same as lining. Bake till
crust is done, and you will have a good chicken
pie.</p>


<p><b>Creamed Chicken.</b>—Make 1 cup cream
sauce (see <a href="#Meat_and_Fish_Sauces">Sauces</a>). Prepare 2 cups diced
cooked chicken. Add to sauce, season well,
simmer 10 minutes.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="STRICTLY_PURE"><span class="fs150">ROYAL</span><br>
A STRICTLY PURE, CREAM OF TARTAR BAKING POWDER</h2>
</div>



<p class="noindent drop-cap"><span class="uc">The</span> tests made by the Government chemists show that Royal
Baking Powder is of the highest efficiency and usefulness as a
leavening agent; that it does not contain alum, ammonia, or lime, and
is absolutely pure. The official tests by the various State Food Commissions,
Boards of Health, and official analysts show no other baking
powder so pure, strong, and healthful.</p>

<p>More ill health and physical discomfort result from unwholesome
food than from any other one cause, and chief among unwholesome
foods are the alum and other cheaply made baking powders.</p>

<p>The market is full of low-grade powders, mostly made from burnt
alum and phosphatic acid. The sale of these powders is urged by some
dealers because they are bought cheap at wholesale and yield them
large profits. Consumers should <em>ask for Royal and take no substitute</em>.</p>

<p>Alum baking powders are classed as poisonous by the most eminent
physicians. They cost but three cents a pound to make, and being sold
at from twenty to forty cents, are also a commercial fraud. They cause
indigestion, heartburn, dyspepsia, and diseases of the liver and kidneys.
Consumers who value their health must be on their guard against
these dangerous powders. It will be safer in all cases to <em>demand the
Royal and take no other</em>.</p>

<p>The housewife will find no possible substitute for the Royal Baking
Powder. There is no other baking powder or preparation that will
render the food so excellent in every quality.</p>

<p><b>Instead of cream of tartar and soda</b>, or soda and sour milk, the
best housekeepers now use Royal Baking Powder. It is almost impossible
for the housekeeper to procure pure cream of tartar. Professor
Chandler, when president of the New York Board of Health, stated in
an official report that he found upon investigation that nearly all the
cream of tartar sold by grocers was adulterated with white clay, alum,
or other hurtful substance. These ingredients are dangerous to health,
impoverishing the blood, producing dyspepsia, etc. Professor Chandler
strongly recommends the use of a well-known baking powder (like the
Royal) in all kinds of baking as more convenient, economical, and
healthful.</p>

<p>Royal Baking Powder is sold only in securely labeled tin cans.</p>

<p><b>Remember</b>, in all old receipts where cream of tartar and soda or
saleratus are called for, you can substitute Royal Baking Powder and
get better results.</p>

<p>The usual proportions, old way, are: 2 teaspoonfuls cream of tartar
to 1 of soda or saleratus;</p>

<p>Instead of which <span class="smcap">use 2 teaspoonfuls of Royal Baking Powder</span>,
and mix it with the flour while dry. This powder is so pure and perfectly
combined that one third less will do better work.</p>

<p><b>Never use so-called prepared or self-raising flours. They
mostly contain alum, phosphates, or other injurious ingredients.</b></p>
